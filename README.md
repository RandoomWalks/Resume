### **Projects**

**Distributed Hash Table (Kademlia DHT) System**

- **Languages**: Rust ([GitHub](https://github.com/RandoomWalks/kademlia_mvp))  
- Implementation of a DHT system for a decentralized network, focusing on optimizing lookup times and reducing message overhead.  
- Designed caching techniques and routing table management strategies, reducing average lookup time.  
- Developed a custom XOR metric for node distance calculation, improving routing efficiency.  
- Enhanced fault tolerance through adaptive mechanisms for dynamic node management.

**Sparse Merkle Tree (Implementation and Benchmarking)**

- **Languages**: Rust ([Github](https://github.com/RandoomWalks/SimpleSparseMerkle))	  
- Implemented and benchmarked two variations of a Sparse Merkle Tree (Array-based and Tree-based) to evaluate performance and memory usage for a decentralized system.  
- Analyzed memory usage and performance, minimizing heap allocations and optimizing memory efficiency under 100 MB while supporting up to 1 million leaves.  
- Improved memory efficiency by implementing a BTreeMap for key-value storage, achieving low heap usage (74 KB peak) with minimal dynamic allocations.  
- Conducted in-depth profiling to identify and resolve issues related to process termination and high RSS, ensuring scalability and system stability.
